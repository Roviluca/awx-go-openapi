/*
 * SettingsSettingsList  List Settings
 *
Make a GET request to this resource to retrieve the list of
settings.

The resulting data structure contains:

    {
        "count": 99,
        "next": null,
        "previous": null,
        "results": [
            ...
        ]
    }

The `count` field indicates the total number of settings
found for the given query.  The `next` and `previous` fields provides links to
additional results if there are more than will fit on a single page.  The
`results` list contains zero or more setting records.

## Results

Each setting data structure includes the following fields:

* `url`:  (string)
* `slug`:  (string)
* `name`:  (string)



## Sorting

To specify that settings are returned in a particular
order, use the `order_by` query string parameter on the GET request.

    ?order_by=name

Prefix the field name with a dash `-` to sort in reverse:

    ?order_by=-name

Multiple sorting fields may be specified by separating the field names with a
comma `,`:

    ?order_by=name,some_other_field

## Pagination

Use the `page_size` query string parameter to change the number of results
returned for each request.  Use the `page` query string parameter to retrieve
a particular page of results.

    ?page_size=100&page=2

The `previous` and `next` links returned with the results will set these query
string parameters automatically.

## Searching

Use the `search` query string parameter to perform a case-insensitive search
within all designated text fields of a model.

    ?search=findme

(_Added in Ansible Tower 3.1.0_) Search across related fields:

    ?related__search=findme

(list, required)
* `PROXY_IP_ALLOWED_LIST`: If Tower is behind a reverse proxy/load balancer, use this setting to configure the proxy IP addresses from which Tower should trust custom REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS header values. If this setting is an empty list (the default), the headers specified by REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS will be trusted unconditionally&#39;) (list, required)
